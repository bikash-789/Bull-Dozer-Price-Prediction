    "> How well can we predict the future price of a bulldozer, given its characterstics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?\n",

    "* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
